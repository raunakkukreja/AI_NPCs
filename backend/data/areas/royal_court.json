  "role": "Government Building",
  "description": "A bastion of order and law, the grand Royal Court stands as a symbol of the city's enduring power. Its ornate tiled plaza is patrolled by loyal guards, and its marble halls dispense the crown's justice. Yet, whispers in the market and the weary expressions of the guards themselves suggest that its principles may be more flexible than the stone from which it is built."
