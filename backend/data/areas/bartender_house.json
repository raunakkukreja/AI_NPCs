  "description": "What was once a humble eatery owned by a foster family has been transformed by Robert Desmos into the city's most popular tavern. The Inn is more than a place for drink; it is the city's living memory. Every patron leaves a story behind, and Robert, the quiet keeper of these tales, forgets nothing."
