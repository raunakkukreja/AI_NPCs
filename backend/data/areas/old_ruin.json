  "description": "Standing as a grim monument on the edge of the market, these crumbling stones are all that remain of the old senate building, destroyed in the devastating \"Senators' Affair\" that led to a bloody revolt years ago. The city tries to forget the tragedy, leaving the ruins overgrown and silentâ€”a place of hushed secrets and a stark warning against challenging the court."
