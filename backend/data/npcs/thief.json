Now running a popular food stall as a front, this charismatic information broker was wrongly imprisoned after a city revolt. The experience taught him that the system is a game, and he now plays it better than anyone. He is charming and witty, but underneath, he is sharp, calculating, and constantly looking for a chance to settle his score with the court. (Interact with Helios to trade information, but be wary of his motives.)",
